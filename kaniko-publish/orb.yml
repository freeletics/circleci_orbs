  Build and publish container images to container registries *without* docker

  Under the hood this uses Google's Kaniko project, but aims to provide a
  very similar interface as the circleci/docker-publish orb.

  See https://github.com/freeletics/circleci_orbs/tree/master/kaniko-publish-orb for the full details.

  The kaniko binary is quite fussy, so I suggest you try and stick to using
  the provided job or at least the executor. If you need to do more work
  consider either doing it in a previous job and transferring via a workspace,
  or build a container based on the one we're using.
